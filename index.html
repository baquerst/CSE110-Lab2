      <p>I’m a 4th year Cognitive Science: Design and Interaction student at
         <span style="color:blue">UCSD</span> with a Computer Science minor.

      <p>Some of my favorite programming languages are listed below from most to least liked</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I ranked Java as my most liked programming language because of how familiar I am with it. 
        It was the first programming language I learned, so I feel I have the most knowledge in this language. Writing a main 
        method using <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> feels natural to me because of how much time I spent 
        coding in Java.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, I have aspirations to become a UX designer or Front-end developer but I still have 
        <b>a lot</b> to learn and experience. Below is a list of the accomplishments I have achieved 
        and hope to achieve in the future.

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>When I’m not studying or putting time into coding, I like to play video games and watch anime.</p>
      <p>Some games I enjoy playing include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Valorant</li>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of my favorite animes I’ve watched, <i>NANA</i>, includes a quote from the protagonist Nana Osaki where she says<br>
         <pre><em>Don’t just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.</em></pre>
      </p>
      <p>This quote helps remind me that failures are a part of every process in life, and that it shouldn’t 
        discourage me but instead keep me motivated to reach my end goal.
      </p>
      
      <p>I've also watched a lot of other animes and below you can see a table containing animes I would recommend and my rating of them.</p>
