      <p>Some of my favorite programming languages are listed below from most to least liked</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I ranked Java as my most liked programming language because of how familiar I am with it. It was the first programming language I learned, so I feel I have the most knowledge in this language. Writing a main method using <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> feels natural to me because of how much time I spent coding in Java.</p>

      <p>Right now, I have aspirations to become a UX designer or Front-end developer but I still have <b>a lot</b> to learn and experience. Below is a list of the accomplishments I have achieved and hope to achieve in the future.</p>

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>When I’m not studying or putting time into coding, I like to play video games and watch anime.</p>
      <p>Some games I enjoy playing, and my rank in them, include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Valorant</li>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>One of my favorite animes I’ve watched, <i>NANA</i>, includes a quote from the protagonist Nana Osaki where she says<br>
         <pre><em>Don’t just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.</em></pre>
